## Requirements

### Git

In order to checkout this code, first install Git and clone the code using
the tools above.

In order to get started, please install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 1.19
or above.

### Make

Please refer to [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows) in order to install on Windows.

#### Linux

You'll likely know how to do this, but refer to your package manager for
instructions. If you're on ubuntu, it'll probably be:

```
$ sudo apt-get -y install make
```

#### macOS

I've not used macOS in a number of years, but you should be able to use
Make once you've installed [Xcode developer tools](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/).
